Ubuntu Remaster is a set of automated scripts for taking a stock ISO
distribution image from Canonical and recreating it with changes and
additional content.  It is broken up into layered branches to allow
you to make your own optionally encrypted ISO images.  Customizers can
branch off various 'layers' to add their custom content to an existing
image.

This branch extends the master branch to create the GNU Radio Live SDR
Environment image.

Using the Ubuntu Remaster build scripts

To create a remastered Ubuntu ISO file, with no further customization
beyond what is done in these scripts, simply do the following:

$ git clone -b <desired branch> https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio-livesdr.git
$ cd gnuradio-livesdr
$ make deps
$ make config
$ make

This will require 'sudo' access. Everything is completely automated,
except for passphrase entry when making an encrypted image (see
below), and possible password prompts for 'sudo' operation.

## Adding a trusted signing key for Ubuntu
After confirming signature out-of-band, use the following to trust the Ubuntu Signing Key
```
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv <THE-KEY-ID>
gpg --edit <THE-KEY-ID>
trust
<PICK A TRUST LEVEL WITH A NUMBER>
save
```
